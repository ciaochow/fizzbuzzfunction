	<h1>Fizzbuzz exercise refactored using a Javascript function</h1>
	<h3>Created by CiaoChow</h3>
	<p>The program is different from your standard Fizzbuzz exercise (ex: 1 - 100) in that instead, the user is prompted to supply an whole number of their choice.  We then verify that the user input is a real number (Ex: 12, not 'twelve') and that it is a whole number (no decimal points).  We then count from 1 to the user's number and display the results.  It will replace numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with “fizz buzz”, those divisible by 3 with “fizz”, and those divisible by 5 with “buzz”.</p>
